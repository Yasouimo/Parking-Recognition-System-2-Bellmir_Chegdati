# SVM model
The `model.p` file holds a trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. SVM is a machine learning method that helps classify data by finding the best boundary to separate different categories. It works well for both simple and complex patterns.

# Yolov8 model
The `best.pt` file contains a trained YOLOv8 model. YOLOv8 is a cutting-edge object detection algorithm that identifies and locates objects in images or videos. Itâ€™s fast, accurate, and works well with real-world scenarios.
